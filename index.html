  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I’m a Jane of all trades, curious about a lot of things and constantly pondering the mysteries of the universe. I love building strategies, solving problems and growth hacking. I’ve been blessed with a lot of good fortune in my life and I’m passionate about sharing it with others through my work.</p>
  <p>What's important to me, you ask? Three things: freedom, justice and chocolate. In that order!</p>

  <h1>More about me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>Reading and writing have been my constant hobbies for as long as I can remember. Photography has been with me for the better part of the past 8 years, and I’ve found that volunteering for non-profits is a rather productive and fun way to procrastinate.</p>
  
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>Starting a social enterprise that changes the lives of women in developing countries for the better.</p>
  
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>Just looping through my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=LLfohOS9roukYAw5ZyaQN3ew">YouTube playlist</a> on repeat, adding songs old and new when I find them.
